A Jupyter notebook implementation of [Christopher Carlson][carlson]'s
multi-scale Truchet tiles.

I wrote a [blog post](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202208/truchet_images.html)
about it.

The code is Apache licensed.  Images you make with it are your own.  It would be
cool if you gave me a shout-out in some way.
